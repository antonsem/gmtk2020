Dear Sir/Madam

I'm a great programmer and a hard worker. I never skipped
a deadline in my entire life. In fact, I was born in the
sixth month. I don't have a family so I can work 24/7.

The job posting says the salary will be 2^(0.57) times
more than the minimum wage (an interview question in
the job posting, I like it!). I read that 80% of this
county's population is overweight. I don't want that,
I should eat less anyway.

So as you can see I think I will be a perfect fit for
your team! Find my resume and an example project
in the attachment. Looking forward to hearing from you!
